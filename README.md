# BackgroundSetter
This is a personal project created which retrieves an image from a given URL,
resizes the image, and sets it as your desktop background image. It is a
continuous process that updates the image every interval of time.

## Script
An example of a visual basic script has been included which can be used to
run a jar artifact as a background process. By placing this script in your
operating system's startup folder your desktop background will always display
the most recent version of the image you desire.
